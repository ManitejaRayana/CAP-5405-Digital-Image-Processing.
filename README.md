Image Processing Techniques Assignment
This repository contains the code for an image processing assignment, demonstrating various techniques using Python.

Assignment Tasks
Binary Mask and Filters

Create a binary mask for a region of interest
Apply low-pass filters (Gaussian and Average)
Apply high-pass filters (Laplacian and Prewitt)
Dithering Algorithms

Implement Floyd-Steinberg dithering
Implement Jarvis-Judice-Ninke dithering
Compare results from both methods
Kuwahara Filter

Explain the Kuwahara filter
Implement and apply the Kuwahara filter
Fourier Transform and Frequency Domain Filters

Apply Fourier Transform to an image
Implement Butterworth filter
Implement Gaussian filter
Image Quantization

Quantize an image to 32 grayscale levels using only the imresize function
Document the steps followed in the process
Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pillow (PIL)
Matplotlib
OpenCV (cv2)
scikit-image
Usage
Each task is implemented in a separate section of the code. To run a specific task:

Ensure all required libraries are installed.
Update the image_path variable with the path to your input image.
Run the corresponding code section for the desired task.
Notes
The code is designed for grayscale images. Color images will be converted to grayscale.
Results are visualized using Matplotlib.
Some techniques may be computationally intensive for large images.
